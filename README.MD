# Generative Deep Learning

## Work in Progress

A collection of notebooks learning Deep Learning while going through the book Generative Deep Learning by David Foster.

1. [Autoencoders](https://github.com/markredito/generative-deep-learning/blob/main/Autoencoders.ipynb) - A neural network that are made of an encoder (compressing high dimensional data into an embedding vector) and decoder (decompressing an embedding vector back to its original form, ie. an image).
