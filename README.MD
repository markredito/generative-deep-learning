# Generative Deep Learning

## Work in Progress

A collection of notebooks learning Deep Learning while going through the book Generative Deep Learning by David Foster.

1. [Autoencoders](https://github.com/markredito/generative-deep-learning/blob/main/Autoencoders.ipynb) - A neural network that are made of an encoder (compressing high dimensional data into an embedding vector) and decoder (decompressing an embedding vector back to its original form, ie. an image).
2. [VAE with Kpop Idol Faces](https://github.com/markredito/generative-deep-learning/blob/main/VAE_Kpop_Idol_Faces.ipynb) - Trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on Kpop Idol Faces to learn the fundamentals of VAEs.
